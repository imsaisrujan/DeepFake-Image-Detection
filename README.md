## 🧪 How It Works

### 📥 1. Image Preprocessing
- Resize, normalize images
- Noise reduction (if applicable)

### 🧠 2. Deep Learning Model
- Load pre-trained model or define CNN
- Train with labeled data (real vs fake)

### 📊 3. Evaluation & Output
- Plot accuracy/loss curves
- Confusion matrix
- Visual classification of sample images

## 📊 Sample Output

| Real Image | Predicted Real |  
|------------|----------------|  
| ![real](assets/real_sample.jpg) | ✅ |

| Deepfake Image | Predicted Fake |  
|----------------|----------------|  
| ![fake](assets/fake_sample.jpg) | ❌ |

> *(Add your own images to `assets/` for visual demonstration.)*

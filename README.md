## 🧪 How It Works

### 📥 1. Image Preprocessing
- Resize, normalize images
- Noise reduction (if applicable)

### 🧠 2. Deep Learning Model
- Load pre-trained model or define CNN
- Train with labeled data (real vs fake)

### 📊 3. Evaluation & Output
- Plot accuracy/loss curves
- Confusion matrix
- Visual classification of sample images

## 🧠 Explainability with LIME

This project integrates **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to increase model transparency and interpretability.

✅ Understand **why** the model predicted an image as real or fake  
✅ Visual explanations highlight **important pixel regions**  
✅ Enhance trust and **debugging ability** for deep learning models

> 📍 Example: LIME will highlight facial regions that influenced the classification decision.
